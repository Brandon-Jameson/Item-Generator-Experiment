# Item-Generator-Experiment
A small experiment playing around with generating random composite objects.

Comprised of Materials, Rarities, and ItemTypes, I am hoping to build a scalable, performant, and -most importanlty- an easy-to-work-with tool for future use in other projects.

## The Idea
* Create a generator that will update the UI to display the item's Rarity, Material, ItemType
* Create actual objects that will represent these 3 unique, and interconnected aspects. ItemTypes will be swords and helmets, Materials will give bonuses or maluses, rarity will improve the final product and have those nice colours we all love in RPG's
